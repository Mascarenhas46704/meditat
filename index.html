                <button class="faq-question">How do I start meditating? </button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>There are a wide array of methods to get started with meditation. Some of these include: taking an online course to learn the basics, get a meditation app that teaches you the basics and provides you with a library of online courses, or visit a meditation studio near you to learn from someone in person. When starting out, remember that meditation is a practice and a skill, and it will require time to get better at it. Like everything else, developing the habits that are involved in meditation requires regular practice and discipline. </p>

                <button class="faq-question">Do I have to be thoughtless during meditation?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The simple answer to this question is no. Meditation is all about quieting the thoughts of the mind, however, being truly thoughtless is something that very few people in the world ever achieve. For 99% of meditators, meditation is the practice of exercising focus, and as thoughts come into our awareness or distract us, intentionally bringing our minds back to focus. Thoughts will always arise during meditation, and that is absolutely normal. The goal is not to become truly thoughtless, but to change the relationship we have with our thoughts. The relationship we want to change is the importance that we give to our thoughts. By learning how to detach from thoughts in order to return to focus, we are learning how to detach from the meaning and the control that we give to them, which allows us to become more intentional with our focus and our attention.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">How do I start a meditation session?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The best way to start a meditation session is to dive into a state of calm with several deep breaths. By taking 4 or more deep breaths with slightly longer exhales, we can ease ourselves into a relaxed physiological state that will facilitate the relaxed attention that is usually the end goal of meditation. Another popular way to start a meditation session is to intentionally reconnect with the present moment. This often looks like shifting focus after 30 seconds to a minute from the smells of the present, to the bodily sensations of the present, to some sounds you are hearing, and some of the tastes you are experiencing. The goal is to run through the senses and pay close attention to whatever version of those the present moment has to offer up. </p>

                <button class="faq-question">How to change my life with meditation?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You can change your life with meditation by adopting a daily meditation practice. Daily meditation for 15 minutes or more has been shown to improve memory recall, cognitive performance, compassion & empathy, and rational thinking, all while combating depression and anxiety by making the brain less likely to even experience stress in the first place. One thing most people are surprised to learn is that meditation is a daily practice of most of the world’s highest functioning people, including people like Lebron James, Steve Jobs, Arianna Huffington, Will Smith, and Kendrick Lamar to name just a few of the hundreds and thousands. Meditation is a great starting point to begin creating changes in your life for the better</p>
